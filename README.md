# 📘 CTSE Lecture Notes Chatbot

This project implements a domain-specific question-answering chatbot for the "Current Trends in Software Engineering" (CTSE) module using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It enables students to ask free-form questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers based on lecture notes.

The system is built using:
- **MiniLM** for semantic similarity and retrieval
- **Flan-T5** for generating fluent answers
- **FAISS** for fast vector-based search
- **Gradio** for an interactive web interface

- **Google Drive Folder (Source Code + Demo Video)**

## 🚀 Features

- Semantic search over PDF lecture notes using MiniLM
- Context-aware answers generated by Flan-T5
- Clean, interactive UI built with Gradio
- Fully offline and private (no cloud APIs)
- Modular architecture: retrieval and generation are decoupled
